<b>Project Simba</b>

Simba started as a joint collaboration between Stanford’s Language and Cognition Lab and Computer Vision Lab as a way to allow anyone to use computer visions algorithms to track people, faces, hands, cars, objects and really anything that moves in video. It was my 2013 summer project under Dr. Guido Pusiol, a postdoc in Stanford’s Computer Vision Lab and Dr. Michael Frank, Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Stanford Language and Cognition Lab.
