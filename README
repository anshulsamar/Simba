Project Simba

Simba allows anyone to use computer visions algorithms to track people, faces, hands, cars, objects and really anything that moves in video. It was my 2013 summer project under Dr. Guido Pusiol, a postdoc in Stanfordâ€™s Computer Vision Lab and Dr. Michael Frank, Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Stanford Language and Cognition Lab.
