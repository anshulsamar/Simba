Project Simba

Simba allows researchers to use computer visions algorithms to track people, faces, hands, cars, and moving objects in video.  As part of this project, I programmed a multi-threated tracking system using open source tracking libraries (libccv, OpenCV, OpenTLD), wrote a platform to do statistical analysis on video data,  and built a Mac app. Code written in C++.
